<p>
The 2023 Cricket World Cup winner prediction using the <strong>Random Forest algorithm</strong> involves a machine learning technique that analyzes various historical and current cricket data factors, such as team performance, player statistics, pitch conditions, and more. By considering these factors, the Random Forest algorithm generates predictions for the tournament's winner. 
This method enhances the accuracy of predictions by aggregating multiple decision trees and ultimately helps cricket enthusiasts and analysts make informed guesses about the potential champion of the 2023 Cricket World Cup.

<h2>GOALS</h2>
<ul>
<li>To forecast the tournament's winner with a high degree of accuracy, based on historical and current data.</li>
<li>To analyze various cricket-related data, including team performance, player statistics.</li>
<li>To identify and evaluate the most influential factors affecting a team's chances of winning, helping teams and analysts focus on critical aspects.</li>
<li>Additionally, predict the results of individual matches throughout the entire tournament.</li>
<li>Conduct simulations for upcoming matches, specifically the semi-finals and finals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DATA</h2>
<p>
The data was collected from HowStat.com, which includes the results of ODI matches since the 2015 World Cup. 
While the model's accuracy may not be exceptionally high, it provides a reasonably good sense of the trends. 
The matches prior to the 2015 World Cup are not considered because recent results tend to be more influential, with older data carrying less weight. 
The remaining data files were sourced them from the Cricbuzz website.

<h2>ENVIRONMENT & TOOLS</h2>
<ol>
<li>Google Colab</li>
<li>Numpy</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Seaborn</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>Scikit-learn</li>
</ol>

<p>
The datasets consisting of the ICC rankings as of August 2023 and a fixture dataset outlining the group stage matches for the tournament, were considered for prediction.
The Random Forest algorithm achieved a training accuracy of 74.0% and a test accuracy of 67.1%.

Based on the outcomes of this model, it suggests that <strong>India</strong> has a higher likelihood of winning the World Cup.
